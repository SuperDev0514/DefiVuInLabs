/*
Name: Self-Destruct Vulnerability

Description:
The EtherGame Self-Destruct Vulnerability is a flaw in the smart contract code that allows an attacker 
to disrupt the game by causing the EtherGame contract to self-destruct (using the selfdestruct opcode). 
The vulnerability arises due to the dos function in the Attack contract, which performs a self-destruct
operation on the EtherGame contract after receiving a significant amount of Ether. As a result of the self-destruct, 
the EtherGame contract's functionality is permanently disabled, making it impossible for anyone to deposit or claim the winner's reward.

Scenario:
1. Deploy EtherGame
2. Players (say Alice and Bob) decides to play, deposits 1 Ether each.
2. Deploy Attack with address of EtherGame
3. Call Attack.attack sending 5 ether. This will break the game No one can become the winner.

What happened?
Attack forced the balance of EtherGame to equal 7 ether.
Now no one can deposit and the winner cannot be set.
Due to missing or insufficient access controls, malicious parties can self-destruct the contract.
The selfdestruct(address) function removes all bytecode from the contract address and sends all ether stored to the specified address.

Mitigation:
Instead of relying on this.balance to track the deposited Ether, 
use a state variable to keep track of the total deposited amount.
